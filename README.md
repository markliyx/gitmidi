**Project Outline**

## Motivation:

any sort of complex digital collaboration projects involve careful tracking of
changes (versioning), branching, merge conflict resolution, and storage. For software
development, there exists tool such as git; now, another emerging form of online collaboration
lies in the arts. Whether it is digital music (electronic music), digital visual arts
(digital paintings), or even NFT tokens, online collaborations for these art forms is
inevitable for multiple reasons; to list a few, **cost & time efficiency**, **ideation efficiency**,
**specializations enablement**, and **network effect**. These reasons will be further elaborated
as the scope of the project grows. 

For the sake of hypothesis, let's assume such reasons
hold, then let's consider the potential difficulties for online collaboration of digital arts.

## Problems:

** Let's define the problems as follow  -

1. **Version Control Vulnerability** - the risk of information being lost at any instant of
the project when an artist tries to restore a previous draft. Such information can be a
small part of the art being restored incorrectly given the correct draft is restored or
the wrong draft is restore given the contents in that draft is correct.
2. **Merging/ Conflict Resolution Barrier** - Such barrier can be (1) Difficulty of visualizing/
listening to changes; hence, comprehending changes in a meaningful way. (2) Time complexity of detecting conflicts. (3) How to define ownership/ rights to a particular change
3. **Economic Cloud-based Host** - To incentivize online collaboration, tools built around it should be economical (let's, for now, define baseline of being "economical" as freemium). 
4. **Ownership logging** - The ambiguity of ownership for a mass collaborated (let's, for now, define mass as # collaborators > 10) project can emerge conflicts. How do we define and divide ownership in a meaningful should be considered carefully. 

## Solution:

Let's jog down some rough ideas. 

**Basic** -  A git like tool for branching out an artwork, and supports meaningful merging operations. 

**Intermediate** -  Basic + Github like online community and host for project files to be backed in the cloud. 

**Advanced** -  Intermediate + a massive cloud online community, where ownership is not defined individually; instead, whoever makes contribution to an artwork gains tokens/ shares representing distribution of such ownership. (Challenge note: to have a meaningful definition of ownership is essential in this framework). 

## Project Steps (updates in realtime project progression):

1. **Fix types of art form:** electronic music expressed as midi files
    
    **Problem to tackle:** build out a merge visualization engine for midi files 
    
    **Tech Stack:** JavaScript, TypScript, React.js, Visx.js, D3.js, 

    
    **Timeline:** done by 15th of Nov
